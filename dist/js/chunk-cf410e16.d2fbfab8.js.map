These include a fresh tax cut for the middle class, a ban on assault weapons and more ambitious targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

With their smaller populations, they have long chafed at the imbalance of power between them and the more populous central provinces.

Although the Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-François Blanchet, favours secession it did not make that a centrepiece of its campaign. The headache it will pose comes from a law passed by Quebec’s right-leaning government this year, which prohibits many civil servants from wearing religious symbols including turbans, hijabs and kippas. The Bloc is solidly behind it. Mr Blanchet has vowed to block any federal attempt to challenge the law, something Mr Trudeau is under pressure to do from his own supporters.\")]),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"Canada’s internal fissures would be difficult for a majority government to deal with, let alone a minority administration that must win support from smaller parties. Mr Trudeau, the son of a former prime minister, can only hope that his fortunes follow his father’s. In an election in 1972 Pierre Trudeau saw his Liberal majority government reduced to a minority. Two years later he won a new majority. He ended up governing Canada, with a brief interruption, until 1984.
