But a bigger factor in the rejection was the widespread sense in the epp and the s&d that Mrs von der Leyen herself had been imposed on them. They would have preferred the next Commission president to be one of their own “lead candidates” who campaigned for the job ahead of the European elections in May. The apparent expectation that they defer to her and Mr Macron’s choice of internal market commissioner prompted the revolt. “Guys, we are going to kill [Goulard] in the vote later but do not say until then,” read an internal epp memo accidentally tweeted ahead of the ballot.

It could all take even longer. Neither Mr Macron nor Mrs von der Leyen has the parliamentary muscle needed to guarantee that the next French nominee will meet with the support that eluded Ms Goulard. The French president’s power base there is not yet commensurate with his dominance among national leaders; he long dragged his feet on his party’s incorporation into the liberal group, considering himself above the contest between the eu’s party groups.
