Mr Trudeau’s first task will be to find a party to back his government. Canada has plenty of experience of Parliaments in which no party has a majority, for example in 2004, 2006 and 2008. The Liberals’ most natural partner is the New Democratic Party (although the NDP has lost 18 seats). The NDP’s leader, Jagmeet Singh, said during the campaign he would do “whatever it takes” to keep the Conservatives from power.

That means that Mr Trudeau is likely to be able to enact his signature policies in his second term as prime minister. These include a fresh tax cut for the middle class, a ban on assault weapons and more ambitious targets for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. But he will now have to reckon with the priorities of the NDP, which shares some of the Liberals’ goals but not its centrist instincts. The NDP has a long wishlist, including a national government-run drug plan (costing an estimated C$43bn, or $33bn), interest-free student loans, cuts to phone bills, investment in affordable housing and a new “super wealth tax”.

Mr Singh opposes construction of the Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX), a project to twin an existing oil pipeline from Alberta to a terminal near Vancouver. That will put him at odds with Mr Trudeau, whose government bought the pipeline from a private firm in 2018 and backed its expansion as a way to help Alberta’s oil industry.

Yet if the Liberals are pushed to the left by Mr Singh and the NDP, this will sharpen the alienation already felt by solidly Conservative Alberta and Saskatchewan. With their smaller populations, they have long chafed at the imbalance of power between them and the more populous central provinces. Their anger has deepened since 2014, when global oil prices slumped, causing local economic hardship. Jason Kenney, the Conservative premier of Alberta, blames the Liberal’s climate-change policies for worsening the situation.
