Data has the potencial to be anything.
and 5571 lines of text can result in a 100 and so pages novel or into a Blogk, this Blogk.

Introduction is about the important data between those 5571 lines that I will need for 
future using, during the designing and programming of this blogk.

---

No logk (or even a regular Blog) can exist without text/language
and for that we are using markdown and html.

both markdown and html are markup languages, computer languages that use tags to define elements in the text.

lets start with markdown, 
ez to read and plain text format..
we get simple stylying on plain text.
no needing tags speed, tags which plague a document can ruin readability , 
to style inline text elements. simpler, no tags, 

while html is the principal markup language used to build web pages, the inclusion of tags to 
define can sometimes intralciare the readibility of the text but the use of classes and its natural interaction (more easy)
with css can allow a more profiound use of styling and position of most of the layout of te various elements.
and its responsable for the layout of this page.

both markdown and html are easily convertible to each other
and inded using the simple markdown I got with this blogk skeleton
but narration need rythim and to do so I needed images and background.

defining text with different styling option is usefull to define the rythim of the text for example we
can do list estremely simply with

- a programming language
- has to be used while
* writing the
+ elements on it

<pre class="codice col-md-10"> 
- each different 
* leaves a space
+ in between if not repeated
</pre>

1. this is the first
2. also remember the space 
3. and the dot next the number

or we can use it in text 
### we can use asteriks to define the height/weight of a font ### with the classic h_ numeration
## do I need it?
# are you sure? 

<pre class="codice col-md-10"> 
### we can use asteriks to define the height/weight of a font ### with the classic h_ numeration
## do I need it?
# are you sure? 
</pre>

about the sample text
*asteriks* to **get** or _underlings_
<pre class="codice col-md-10"> 
using *asteriks* or more **more asteriks** or even _undelings_
instead of opening each specific tag like <b>asteriks</b> <i>underling</i>
</pre>

it can indeed be simpler to put links  
and this is used for a bit of nice effects details and I used html
[title](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+title&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqsdaOg8HjAhXEJlAKHQMwA1sQ_AUIEygD&biw=1366&bih=625#imgrc=7VYQF4YmOUlDLM:) 

and the square brackets text can be freely styled.
<pre class="codice col-md-10"> 
[title](https://link to be used.com)
</pre>

and in case you have to use multiple times you just referemce mode
like [this one][detroit dab], both square parentesis.

there are more straighforward ways to set links:
<https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/378/030/d4b.jpg> in case you want to show a plain link.
with a pair of < >

what about images, 
![here comes the alt](../../assets/snow.jpg)
kinda similar to links but with an exclamation tag.
but they have different from the others due of the  css.

<pre class="codice col-md-10"> 
![here comes the alt](../../assets/snow.jpg)
</pre>

but I indeed have the possibiy to use a horizzontal space
___



what about we can get from htm
but it affeacts te entire line so its better to use <sub> sub tags </sub> or <sup> tags </sup>
or just the impler <b> bold </b> tag.

for example i html and list we have more options dude to the css to use space

or just add the class text-uppercase to the tag.

Blogk posts, in my case, the very basic template I had for this blogk was t use markdown
but considerd the limitations of the version I had that disnt allow me to use all its 
possibilties and also I wanted the size and space possibilities that html offers
anyway considering <sub>(html is retroactive as html)</sub>it wouldnt hacve been such a big problem
here some interesant data for future use./thinks to remmeber
(so for starters lets talk a bit about html and markdown that I use shall we?)

welcome to the audio here 

<audio controls>
  <source src="horse.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  this happears only if source fails
</audio>

<img src="../../assets/snow.jpg" class="tutto">

anyway, remember that if you want to display inline(like span) or in block (like the div tag)
    .tm-textbox { display: block; }

and like summary we can have a schorter version for details
<abbr title="World Health Organization"> under the who? </abbr>

every image has its own template css indicators to so fir the reding rytmin but
in cse you wanted to change the dmencion in particular you have.
in case I want to set some dimenzions for the video link and image

while it would have been faster to have just used markdown we lacked.

markdown is vary of when it is break and whne html gets used insede, 

This format can then, in seconds, be converted into another markup language, such as HTML!

While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are HTML and XML.its a computer language that uses tag to
define text, elements.

both tese
languages uses plain text and are indeed correlted considering 

something its needed to know is that while markdown is easier to use it doesnt allow for
spacing control/ or at least jst for the text effect.
effects are etter used alone and no part of a single text.

<blockquote>
    <p>it seems I cannot do it.</p>
    <p>And the blockquote continues here, too.</p>
</blockquote>

the > doesnt seem to work here.

about Bootstrap tho, ''hidden-md-up'' is used to hide elements that are from md to more.
or we use the -down for smaller.

if you want to select a class within a class just remember to use the dot.

    .cd-slider-nav .nav-link:focus {
        background-color: #1a2d4b;
    }
