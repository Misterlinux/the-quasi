5571 can seem to be both a big and small number, if those were bits it wouldnt even be 0.001% of a medium sized novel.
if we were talking about data.

if thse lines were on a book it wouldnt have been more than a small 100 poages one, and in terms in
data ad those were bytes it wouldnt be like even 0.005 of a book

but those lines and all this blogk are more about the importance of the data displayed, and thse were
what It was needed to get this blogk going.

this introduction (for tose who still reads them) is about the data I gathered and that I tink will be usefull
for future usings. (while designing and programming this blogk), lets start already.

ok so, lets gather some data about what indeed should markdown do.
and its a standard.
after all a markdown text is easily covertible to  html one.

and a simple and understandable syntax.   
and does this work?

the first question on what kind of 
- a programming language 
- has to be used while 
* writing the
+ elements on it
Blogk posts, in my case, the very basic template I had for this blogk was t use markdown
but considerd the limitations of the version I had that disnt allow me to use all its 
possibilties and also I wanted the size and space possibilities that html offers
anyway considering <sub>(html is retroactive as html)</sub>it wouldnt hacve been such a big problem
here some interesant data for future use./thinks to remmeber
(so for starters lets talk a bit about html and markdown that I use shall we?)

### we can use asteriks to define the height/weight of a font ### with the classic h_ numeration
but it affeacts te entire line so its better to use <sub> sub tags </sub> or <sup> tags </sup>
or just the impler <b> bold </b> tag.

I still cant find situation in which I would use markdown instead of html tags. fro example
if we talk about links [title](https://www.google.com/search?q=the+title&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqsdaOg8HjAhXEJlAKHQMwA1sQ_AUIEygD&biw=1366&bih=625#imgrc=7VYQF4YmOUlDLM:)
I guess Its shorter to have a simple square parentesis foe the link text [] and the successive 
curved ones for the link itself (), 

like [this one][detroit dab], both square parentesis.

[detroit dab]: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/378/030/d4b.jpg 

anyway I guess its simpler to just use *asteriks* to **get** a bolder text and be abel to 

<img src="../../assets/inside/1.png" class="righto">

write faster without having to open and close tags, _like_ underscores __or even__

I can also build some tabelle usig sime commas (altrought I still to see how can I use them)

the big problem I have about the text is about how to show up the code...
also I dont have the emojis but i dont think it does mattter.


<code>
	A piece of computer code var y= 32 
    <div> here s some code </div>
    <h3> is this what ya wanted? </h3>
    we can set some code here

      .cd-slider-nav .nav-link:focus {
          background-color: #1a2d4b;
      }
</code><br>

anyway we could even use the tags inside the [ ] to style up the link
there is also a reference mode but It seems kinda too complicated and not very usefull ourtside of repeated 
link postig in the same article

<https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/378/030/d4b.jpg> in case you want to show a plain link.

what about images..
![here comes the alt](../../assets/snow.jpg)
kinda similar to links but with an exclamation tag.

<img src="../../assets/snow.jpg" class="lefto">

about the spacing we had to remember how the blocks are built.  

_for_ example the > doesnt seem to work here.

>the nice thing is that , you can include 
varyous lines of code in a block with just 
one symbol
>
>anyway about order and unordered list

* just
* remember
* to

1. this is the first
2. also remember the space 
3. and the dot next the number

anyway it kinda s come s in handy when its time to out up list and differentiate them with spaces between.

- a programming language 
- has to be used while 
* writing the
+ elements on it

and yeah the suddivision on paragraph is still kinda hard form the simple tab space.

I still need a common base for the intro, I guess I can call it on the basisof language.
ok so, anywa I guess I can set some text about 
about Bootstrap tho, ''hidden-md-up'' is used to hide elements that are from md to more.
or we use the -down for smaller.
anyway remember the selected class on the tag for the html.
if you want to select a class within a class just remember to use the dot.

    .cd-slider-nav .nav-link:focus {
        background-color: #1a2d4b;
    }

I still dont know If I will be using the hero slider, anyway in case of tags and order remember.
data-no="2" inside the tag. and that every element inside of it has to be li /li for each
different page.

anyway it can seem strange but there is indeed different list styles. if you want to set oe use

  list-style-type: upper-roman
  list-style-image: url('  ');

indeed is also possible to set a custom image, I guess.

  list-style-position: inside;

anyway if you are really interested in how the space is managed between the icon and the element of the list
you can use this.

    .tm-textbox { display: block; }

anyway, remember that if you want to display inline(like span) or in block (like the div tag)

about the javascript I guess we can talk about this, to stop one.

                setTimeout(function() {
                    adjustHeightOfPage( currentPageNo );
                }, 3000);

if you want to include video use:

about how to start a page in html with a single tab no closing.

  !DOCTYPE html

and about the meta data to put in the head tag.

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

then if you have to load the css external files you can.

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/bootstrap.min.css"> 

(I guess it works still with the scripts on js and the other css like the hero slider)
ok so, I still need to find how to show video panels (even if it doesnt seem so hard)

        <div class="cd-bg-video-wrapper" data-video="video/bangkok-city">
        </div>

using the data-video property.
a bit of an example on codition on a function.

  if( videoWrapper.is(':visible') )

or just add the class text-uppercase to the tag.

<code>
	A piece of computer code var y= 32 
    <div> here s some code </div>
    <h3> is this what ya wanted? </h3>
    we can set some code here

how does it work?
